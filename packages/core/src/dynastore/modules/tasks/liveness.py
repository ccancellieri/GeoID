"""Runner-agnostic execution-liveness Protocol.

The maintenance reaper resets a lapsed-lease ``ACTIVE`` task back to ``PENDING``
purely on a timer — correct for an in-process runner (the work genuinely died
with the pod), but wrong for a runner whose execution outlives the dispatching
process. A Cloud Run Job spawned fire-and-forget keeps running through its
cold-start window while the spawn lease quietly lapses; the reaper then
reclaims the row mid-boot and a second execution is spawned.

This module defines the contract that lets the reconciler ask the **owning
runner** "is the execution backing this task actually alive?" before the reaper
acts. It is import-light on purpose — no ``google.*`` imports leak into the
dispatch hot path. Each runner whose executions outlive the dispatcher
implements :class:`LivenessProbeProtocol` its own way; in-process runners do
not implement it at all, so :func:`resolve_probe` returns ``None`` for their
owners and the reconciler no-ops — preserving today's reaper-only behavior.
